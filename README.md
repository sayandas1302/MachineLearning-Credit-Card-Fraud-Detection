# MachineLearning-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
In this project we are going to predict whether a credit card transaction is fradulent or not. Here we are given with information on credit card transactions such as time lapse,  amount, and 28 special features (not described) and labels regarding which transactions as fraud and which are not(1 for fraud transaction and 0 for legit transaction). Our objective is to build a model that can predict whether a  particular credit card transaction is fradulent or not.
